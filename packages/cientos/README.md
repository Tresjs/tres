# Cientos

> Collection of useful helpers and fully functional, ready-made abstractions for Tres

- 💡 Build a 3D scene working only with Vue components.
- ⚡️ Powered by Vite
- 🥰 It brings all the updated features of ThreeJS right away regardless the version
- 🦾 Fully Typed

Cientos (the Spanish word for "hundreds", pronounced /θjentos/ ) is a collection of useful ready-to-go helpers and components that are not part of the core package. The name uses the word used in Spanish to multiply by 100, to refer to the potential reach of the package to hold an amazing abstraction.

The cientos package uses `three-stdlib` module under the hood instead of the three/examples/jsm module. This means that you don't need to extend the catalog of components using the extend method from the `core`, cientos does it for you.

It just works. 💯

pnpm i @tresjs/cientos
