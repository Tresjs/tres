# v-log

With the v-log directive provided by **TresJS**, you can do this by just adding `v-log` to the instance.

```vue{2, 11}
<script setup lang="ts">
import { TresCanvas, vLog }  from '@tresjs/core'
import { OrbitControls, Sphere } from '@tresjs/cientos'
</script>
<template>
    <TresCanvas >
    <TresPerspectiveCamera :position="[0, 2, 5]" />
    <Sphere
      ref="sphereRef"
      :scale="0.5"
      v-log
    />
    <OrbitControls v-log />
  </TresCanvas>
</template>
```

## Arguments

Note that you can pass a modifier with the name of **any property**, for example:

```html
    <!-- will log the materials -->
    <Sphere v-log:material />
```

::prose-warning
The component `<TresCanvas >` will not log the canvas or the scene.
