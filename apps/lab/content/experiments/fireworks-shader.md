This experiment recreates the stunning **fireworks shader effect** from [Bruno Simon's Three.js Journey course](https://threejs-journey.com/), adapted for TresJS. Experience dynamic particle explosions with custom GLSL shaders that create realistic fireworks bursts complete with physics-based motion and vibrant color variations.
