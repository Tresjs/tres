## Overview

This experiment demonstrates an interactive particle system that responds to cursor movement. Particles are displaced based on texture data, creating fluid and organic motion effects as you move your mouse across the canvas.

## Inspiration

This experiment is based on the excellent [Three.js Journey](https://threejs-journey.com/) course by [Bruno Simon](https://bruno-simon.com/). The course provides comprehensive lessons on WebGL, Three.js, and shader programming, including advanced particle systems and interactive effects.

## Features

- GPU-accelerated particle rendering for smooth performance
- Texture-based particle displacement
- Interactive cursor tracking
- Real-time particle animation using custom shaders

## Credits

- Concept and techniques from [Three.js Journey](https://threejs-journey.com/) by Bruno Simon
- Implementation adapted for TresJS and Vue 3
