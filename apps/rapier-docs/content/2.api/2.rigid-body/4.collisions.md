To start receiving collisions events, first you need to set the
`active-collision` prop to our `RigidBody` (this set all our automatic
colliders). Then you can start listening for events in `@collision-enter` and/or
`@collision-exit`.

```html
<RigidBody activeCollision @collision-enter="onCollisionEnter" @collision-exit="onCollisionExit">
  <TresMesh>
    <TresTorusGeometry />
    <TresMeshNormalMaterial />
  </TresMesh>
</RigidBody>

```

### `enableCcd`

 You can set continuous collision detection for fast moving object, passing as a prop `enableCcd`.

```html
<RigidBody activeCollision enableCcd @collision-enter="onCollisionEnter" @collision-exit="onCollisionExit">
  <TresMesh>
    <TresTorusGeometry />
    <TresMeshNormalMaterial />
  </TresMesh>
</RigidBody>

```

### `activeCollisionTypes`

You can select between the following props the type of collision that fit best your needs.

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `ALL` | Enable collisions between any kind of rigid-bodies (including between two non-dynamic bodies). |
| `DEFAULT` | The default active collision types, enabling collisions between a dynamic body and another body of any type, but not enabling collisions between two non-dynamic bodies. |
| `DYNAMIC_DYNAMIC` | Enable collision-detection between a collider attached to a dynamic body and another collider attached to a dynamic body. |
| `DYNAMIC_FIXED` | Enable collision-detection between a collider attached to a dynamic body and another collider attached to a fixed body (or not attached to any body). |
| `DYNAMIC_KINEMATIC` | Enable collision-detection between a collider attached to a dynamic body and another collider attached to a kinematic body. |
| `FIXED_FIXED` | Enable collision-detection between a collider attached to a fixed body (or not attached to any body) and another collider attached to a fixed body (or not attached to any body). |
| `KINEMATIC_FIXED` | Enable collision-detection between a collider attached to a kinematic body and another collider attached to a fixed body (or not attached to any body). |
| `KINEMATIC_KINEMATIC` | Enable collision-detection between a collider attached to a kinematic body and another collider attached to a kinematic body. |

```html
<RigidBody activeCollision activeCollisionTypes="ALL" @collision-enter="onCollisionEnter" @collision-exit="onCollisionExit">
  <TresMesh>
    <TresTorusGeometry />
    <TresMeshNormalMaterial />
  </TresMesh>
</RigidBody>
```

### collisionGroups

For more complex scenes you can select how collider interact with each other using collisionsGroups

```html
<RigidBody activeCollision :collisionGroups="0x000D0004" @collision-enter="onCollisionEnter" @collision-exit="onCollisionExit">
  <TresMesh>
    <TresTorusGeometry />
    <TresMeshNormalMaterial />
  </TresMesh>
</RigidBody>
```

### Custom colliders

If you want to detect collisions on custom colliders is the same metodology but applied to the custom collider, for example

```html
<BallCollider
  :args="[1, 1, 1]"
  activeCollision
  @collision-enter="onCollisionEnter"
/>
```

## Events

| Event | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `@collision-enter` | Triggered when a collider starts colliding with another collider. |
| `@collision-exit` | Triggered when a collider stops colliding with another collider. |
