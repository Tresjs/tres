title: Collisions
description:
---

To start receiving collisions events, first you need to set the
`active-collision` prop to our `RigidBody` (this set all our automatic
colliders). Then you can start listening for events in `@collision-enter` and/or
`@collision-exit`.

```html
...
<RigidBody activeCollision @collision-enter="onCollisionEnter" @collision-exit="onCollisionExit">
  <TresMesh>
    <TresBoxGeometry />
    <TresMeshNormalMaterial />
  </TresMesh>
</RigidBody>
...

```

- You can set continuous collision detection for fast moving object, passing as a
prop `enableCcd`.
- You can specify the collision type using
`activeCollisionTypes` props.
- Also you can set specific collision groups by
using the `collisionGroups` prop.
