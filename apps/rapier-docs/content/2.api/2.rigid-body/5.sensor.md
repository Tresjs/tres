Sensor works pretty similar to [collisions](/api/rigid-body/collisions) but don't generate contacts: they only generate intersection events when one sensor collider and another collider start/stop touching.
```html
<RigidBody activeCollision sensor @intersection-enter="onIntersectionEnter"          @intersection-exit="onIntersectionExit">
  <TresMesh>
    <TresTorusGeometry />
    <TresMeshNormalMaterial />
  </TresMesh>
</RigidBody>
```

## Events

| Event | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `@intersection-enter` | Triggered when a sensor collider starts intersecting another collider. |
| `@intersection-exit` | Triggered when a sensor collider stops intersecting another collider. |
