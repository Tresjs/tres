## From v4 to v5

Cientos doesn't have any breaking changes from v4 to v5 but please check the [Upgrade Guide](https://docs.tresjs.org/getting-started/upgrade-guide) of the core.

## Migration Guide from v3

### Updated defineExport properties

Since the beginning we exported our components' underlying `Three.js` instances using the name `value`. This created a very ambiguos situation with some components. When we access them using a `ref` in `<template>`, we ended up with something like:

```
<script>
import { shallowRef, watch } from 'vue'
import { TresCanvas } from '@tresjs/core'
import { Stars } from '@tresjs/cientos'

const starsRef = shallowRef()

watch(starsRef, () => {
  // to access the instance we have a nested `value.value`
  console.log(starsRef.value.value)
  // Wrong in v4 ❌
})
</script>
<template>
  <TresCanvas>
    ...
    <Stars ref="starsRef" />
    ...
  </TresCanvas>
</template>

```

This created confusion and was not good DX. Unfortunately, to fix this, a breaking change needed to be introduced, and we felt this was the right moment.

The new implementation is very similar, but instead of two confusing `value`s we have standardized all our components with `instance`, so to access the components now use:

```
// Correct in v4 ✅
console.log(starsRef.value.instance)
```

### Remove TweakPane from deps

We removed the built-in `useTweakPane` integration because it was adding overhead and friction:

- Incompatible with [Tweakpane v4](https://tweakpane.github.io/docs/)
- Large bundle impact
- Repetitive boilerplate and not very intuitive

If you still want to use Tweakpane with Tres, follow the cookbook recipe: https://docs.tresjs.org/cookbook/tweakpane.html

### Move directives to core

Community adoption of directives has been solid, so they now live in the core package. Import them from `@tresjs/core`:

```ts
// Correct ✅
import { vLog } from '@tresjs/core'
```

Instead of:

```ts
// Wrong ❌
import { vLog } from '@tresjs/cientos'
```

### Changes in KeyboardControls

`KeyboardControls` was redesigned to provide floating controls similar to Unreal Engine, which better matches the component’s intent. We also bundled `PointerLockControls` inside `KeyboardControls`, so you don’t need to wire it manually anymore.
