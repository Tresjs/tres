**Cientos** provides a component called `BakeShadows`. Basically this component set the renderer.shadowMap.autoUpdate to `false`, so the shadows are casted just in the first frame which is really great for performance, the downside of this method is that the shadows will not be updated.

## Basic usage

::: warning
You have to set the shadows in the `TresCanvas` (renderer), your light sources and objects to receive and cast accordantly as you normally would do.
