# OrbitControls

[OrbitControls](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html?q=orbit#examples/en/controls/OrbitControls) is a camera controller that allows you to orbit around a target. It's a great way to explore your scene.

However, it is not part of the core of ThreeJS. So to use it you would need to import it from the `three/examples/jsm/controls/OrbitControls` module.

Here is where the fancy part begins. âœ¨
The `cientos` package provides a component called `<OrbitControls />` that is a wrapper of the `OrbitControls` from the [`three-stdlib`](https://github.com/pmndrs/three-stdlib) module.

The nicest part? You don't need to extend the catalog or pass any arguments.
It just works. ðŸ’¯

## Usage

<<< @/.vitepress/theme/components/OrbitControlsDemo.vue{3,9}

::: warning
Is really important that the Perspective camera is set first in the canvas. Otherwise might break.
