# Announcing cientos v3.5.0 üéâ

We're excited to share with you a new release of `@tresjs/cientos`  full of exciting new features.


## HTML component üñ•Ô∏è

Let's start with a versatile one, the `HTML` component has finally arrived to **Cientos** and brings with it a huge amount of possibilities! Just look at this:

<video class="w-full overflow-hidden rounded" controls autoplay loop>
  <source src="/blog/html-occlude.mp4" type="video/mp4">  
</video>

This component allows you to project HTML content or even Vuejs components into any object in your scene. TresJS will automatically update the position of the HTML content to match the position of the object.

You can even use plain CSS or utilities like [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) to style üé®.

```html
<script setup lang="ts">
import { TresCanvas } from '@tresjs/core'
import {  Html } from '@tresjs/cientos'

</script>

<template>
  <TresCanvas>
    <TresPerspectiveCamera :position="[3, 3, 8]" />
    <OrbitControls />
    <TresMesh :position="[1, 1, 1]">
      <TresBoxGeometry />
      <TresMeshNormalMaterial />
      <Html
        center
        transform
        :distance-factor="4"
        :position="[0, 0, 0.65]"
        :scale="[0.75, 0.75, 0.75]"
      >
        <h1 class="bg-white dark:bg-dark text-xs p-1 rounded">
          I'm a Box üì¶
        </h1>
      </Html>
    </TresMesh>
    <TresGridHelper />
    <TresAmbientLight />
  </TresCanvas>
</template>
```

### `iframe` between threejs objects

Yup.

<video class="w-full overflow-hidden rounded" controls autoplay loop>
  <source src="/blog/html-laptop.mp4" type="video/mp4">  
</video>

You can achieve pretty cool results with the `Html` component by using iframes. For example, you can use an iframe to display a YouTube video in your scene or a webpage within a 3D model.


Please check the official [docs](https://cientos.tresjs.org/guide/misc/html-component.html)

This was provided by [Alvaro Saburido](https://github.com/alvarosabu).

## FBO and useFBO ü™û

The FBO (or Frame Buffer Object) technique allows you to put a render into a texture. We provide this feature as a component or as a composable.

<video class="w-full overflow-hidden rounded" controls autoplay loop>
  <source src="/blog/fbo.mp4" type="video/mp4">  
</video>

To learn more about this powerful component please check [this](https://cientos.tresjs.org/guide/abstractions/fbo.html)

Big thanks to [Francesco Michelini](https://github.com/kekkorider)

## Line2 üìâ

We gave some love to the shape section in this release, bringing to you two new shapes componentes. The first one is `<Line2 />`, which allow you to create easy lines with just a few lines of code.

For more info please check the [official documentation](https://cientos.tresjs.org/guide/shapes/line2.html). 

This component was done by [andretchen0](https://github.com/andretchen0) big thanks to him.

## CatmullRomCurve üí´

Similar to the previous one, the `<CatmullRomCurve3 />` provides smooth curves with almost no configuration.

## GlobalAudio üîä

You can now add sound to your scene with just one component. `<GlobalAudio  />` has landed in **TresJs**. Simply import and use the `<GlobalAudio  />` component, give it music path and just like that you'll get sound.

```vue{3,9}
<script setup>
import { TresCanvas } from '@tresjs/core'
import { GlobalAudio } from '@tresjs/cientos'
</script>

<template>
  <TresCanvas>
    <TresPerspectiveCamera :position="[0, 0, 7.5]" />
    <GlobalAudio :src="exampleAudio" />
  </TresCanvas>
</template>
```
An abstraction of the three [Audio](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html?q=audio#api/en/audio/Audio) instance.

This component was made by [JaimeTorrealba](https://github.com/JaimeTorrealba).

## Directives

A new exiting one, **Cientos** has been experimenting with the original Vue [Directives](https://vuejs.org/guide/reusability/custom-directives.html#introduction). This idea was born in a session between the **TresJs** Core team members, we explored the possibility, and now we're happy to announce that not only is it possible, it's really handy.

So now we have 4 Directives and a new section in cientos for you guys:

### v-log

With v-log you can inspect your instance without the need to use template ref and watch... Just import the directive, and log what you need.

```vue{2,10,12}
<script setup lang="ts">
import { OrbitControls, Sphere, vLog } from '@tresjs/cientos'
</script>
<template>
  <TresCanvas >
    <TresPerspectiveCamera :position="[0, 2, 5]" />
    <Sphere
      ref="sphereRef"
      :scale="0.5"
      v-log:material  <!-- will print just the material üéâ -->
    />
    <OrbitControls v-log />
  </TresCanvas>
</template>
```

Check [here](https://cientos.tresjs.org/guide/directives/v-log.html) for more info.

### v-light-helper

Also for debug purposes, `v-light-helper` aims to add the current helper for the light, this way you don't have to worry about any reference or bloated code, just import and use it with a light, and you'll get the right helper.

```vue{2,8,11,14,17}
<script setup lang="ts">
import { OrbitControls, Sphere, vLightHelper } from '@tresjs/cientos'
</script>
<template>
  <TresCanvas >
    <TresPerspectiveCamera :position="[0, 2, 5]" />
    <TresDirectionalLight
      v-light-helper
    />
    <TresPointLight
      v-light-helper
    />
    <TresSpotLight
      v-light-helper
    />
    <TresHemisphereLight
      v-light-helper
    />
  </TresCanvas>
</template>
```

Visit the [official documentation](https://cientos.tresjs.org/guide/directives/v-light-helper.html) to learn more.


### v-always-look-at

With the `v-always-look-at` as the name suggest you can force the element to always look at a point (even if this is in movement).

```vue{2,10}
<script setup lang="ts">
import { TresCanvas } from '@tresjs/core'
import { Box, vAlwaysLookAt } from '@tresjs/cientos'
</script>

<template>
  <TresCanvas>
    <TresPerspectiveCamera :position="[0, 2, 5]" />
    <Box
      v-always-look-at="new Vector3(0, 0, 0)"
    />
  </TresCanvas>
</template>
```

Learn more [here](https://cientos.tresjs.org/guide/directives/v-always-look-at.html)

### v-distance-to

![v-distance-to directive tresjs](/blog/v-distance-to.png)

Have you ever tried to measure the distance between objects in threejs? Well now it's easier than ever. Just use the `v-distance-to` and you'll get the exact distance. Example:

```html{7}
<Sphere
  ref="sphere1Ref"
  :position="[-2, slider, 0]"
  :scale="0.5"
/>
<Sphere
  v-distance-to="sphere1Ref"
  :position="[2, 0, 0]"
  :scale="0.5"
/>
```
Learn more about these directives [here](https://cientos.tresjs.org/guide/directives/v-distance-to.html)
