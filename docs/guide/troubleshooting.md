# The hilarious guide of common issues and how to solve them

Welcome to **TresJS v2 troubleshooting guide**. Where 3D stands for _"Dazzlingly Delightful Difficulties"_! We know 3D can be as complex as a tangled ball of yarn üß∂ or as unpredictable as a cat on a keyboard üêà ‚å®Ô∏è , but fear not!

This guide is intended to help you solve the most common issues that you might encounter when using TresJS v2.

## I can't see my 3D scene üò≠!

You followed the [Getting started guide](/guide/getting-started.md) but you still can see your scene rendered.

These are the most common reasons why you might not be able to see your scene:

### Check the height of your canvas üìè

Another common issue is that the `TresCanvas` component is creating by default a `canvas` element takes the `width` and `height` of the parent element. If the parent element has no height, the canvas will have no height either.

You will also see this error in the console:

![Canvas height warning](/canvas-height-warning.png)

A easy way to fix this is to set the height of the parent element to `100%`:

```css
html,
body {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  height: 100%;
  width: 100%;
}
#app {
  height: 100%;
  width: 100%;
  background-color: #000;
}
```

Or you can set the `window-size` prop of the `TresCanvas` component:

```vue
<TresCanvas window-size>
  <TresPerspectiveCamera />
  <TresOrbitControls />
</TresCanvas>
```

## Failed resolve component: TresComponent... ü§î

Since **TresJS v2** is using a Vue Custom Renderer inside of the main Vue App instance, the core Vue renderer that acts as parent is not going to recognize the components inside of `TresCanvas` component. Even if it doesn't affect the rendering, it will show a warning in the console.

At this moment, there is no native Vue support to define the renderer used on the `<template />` but there is a quick workaround to remove the warnings

Got to your `vite.config.ts` and add the following configuration to the `@vitejs/plugin-vue`:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import vue from '@vitejs/plugin-vue'
import { templateCompilerOptions } from '@tresjs/core'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    vue({
      // Other config
      ...templateCompilerOptions,
    }),
  ],
})
```

This will remove the warning from the console.
