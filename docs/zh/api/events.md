# Events

**TresJS** components emit pointer events when they are interacted with. This is the case for the components that represent three.js classes that derive from [THREE.Object3D](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html?q=object#api/en/core/Object3D) (like meshes, groups,...).

## Pointer Events

```html
<TresMesh
  @click="(intersection, pointerEvent) => console.log('click', intersection, pointerEvent)"
  @pointer-move="(intersection, pointerEvent) => console.log('pointer-move', intersection, pointerEvent)"
  @pointer-enter="(intersection, pointerEvent) => console.log('pointer-enter', intersection, pointerEvent)"
  @pointer-leave="(intersection, pointerEvent) => console.log('pointer-leave', pointerEvent)"
/>
```

The returned [Intersection](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/blob/master/types/three/src/core/Raycaster.d.ts#L16) includes the [Object3D](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html?q=object#api/en/core/Object3D) that triggered the event. You can access it via `intersection.object`.

By default, objects positioned in front of others with event handlers do not prevent those events from being triggered. This behavior can be achieved by using the prop `blocks-pointer-events`.
