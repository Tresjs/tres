# Stacked mode

If you want to disable the float mode and stack the controls, you can do so by setting the `float` prop to `false`.

```vue
<TresLeches :float="false" />
```

The panel will now take the `width` and `height` of the parent container and the following features will be disabled:

- Collapsing
- Floating
- Dragging
- Resizing
